# 🔍💼 Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions using Big Data and Machine Learning 💡💳

This repository contains the project work for the Big Data course, focusing on developing a predictive model for fraud detection in financial transactions. The aim was to create a scalable and efficient fraud detection system leveraging PySpark and machine learning techniques.

## 🛠️ Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
- Cleaned and normalized data to prepare it for analysis.
- Engineered features to enhance model performance.

### Model Selection & Training
- Evaluated various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, random forests, and gradient boosting machines.
- Utilized Apache Spark's distributed computing capabilities to handle large datasets efficiently.

### Model Evaluation
- Focused on metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's effectiveness.

## 📊 Preliminary Results

Initial models demonstrated high accuracy in detecting fraudulent transactions, with the most promising model being Gradient Boosting Trees (GBT). Further refinements are underway to enhance performance.

- **Accuracy**: Almost 98%.
- **Promising Model**: Gradient Boosting Trees (GBT).

This project highlights the potential of combining machine learning and big data to strengthen financial systems against fraud. By employing Apache Spark and advanced ML techniques, we aim to offer a groundbreaking solution for real-time fraud detection.
